We created a google form to survey the usability of our website.
On this survey, we asked the user to do specific actions (without telling them how to do it) and describe the process of performing this action.

We had three questions:
1. Sign up for Athena. (you can use fake email/name). Describe the experience/usability of signing in:
2. Choose a sport and take a survey. Describe the usability of this feature.
3. Create a new game or join an existing game, View your games, and if applicable, take the post-game survey. Describe the usability of this feature.
4. If you have any other comments, please elaborate. (optional)

We surveyed three people. Their responses are as follows:
